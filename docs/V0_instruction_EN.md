# MoodDiary Service Component Design Improvement Instructions

Design improvements are needed to enhance the user experience of the MoodDiary service. Please refer to 'PRD.md' for an overview and description of the service. Update the design of user-provided components consistently.

1. **Reference Image**: Refer to the 'base_design.png' file to improve the overall design of MoodDiary service components.

    - Take visual elements such as colors, layout, typography, button styles, etc. from the reference image and apply them consistently throughout the MoodDiary service.

2. **Design Consistency**:

    - **Maintain Style Guide**: Once a design style is set, apply it consistently across all components. For example, ensure that font styles, button designs, margins, icon sizes, and all UI elements follow the same rules throughout the service.
    - **Unify Background Colors**: Set background colors to be consistent across pages, and use fixed background colors that match the brand image of the MoodDiary service. Even if background color changes are needed, ensure they blend naturally throughout the service.
    - **Typography**: Keep the size and font of titles, body text, and emphasized text consistent across all pages and components.

3. **Maintain Logic**: Improve only the style of components without changing their functional logic. The HTML structure and JavaScript logic should remain unchanged.

4. **Subtle Animation Effects**:

    - Add subtle effects such as button clicks, hover, or transition animations during user interactions to improve the user experience. However, avoid excessive animations and apply the same animation rules across all components.

5. **Responsive Design**:

    - Consider responsive design to ensure all designs work consistently in desktop and mobile environments. Adjust UI elements to follow the same design principles on both mobile and desktop.

6. **Testing and Feedback Collection**:

    - After applying the design, test that it works consistently across various screen sizes and incorporate any modifications based on feedback received.

7. **English Usage**:
    - Please write all style improvement responses in English.
