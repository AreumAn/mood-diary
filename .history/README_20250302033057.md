## Project Overview

MoodDiary is an intuitive journaling service that allows users to write diary entries and automatically analyzes emotions, displaying them visually. Using Google Gemini API, it analyzes the emotional content of diary entries and helps users grasp the mood at a glance through colors and icons based on the detected emotions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **UI Components**: ShadCN UI
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons
- **AI Emotion Analysis**: Google Gemini API
- **Data Storage**: Local Storage

## Key Features

- üìù Diary entry creation and management (CRUD)
- üß† AI-based emotion analysis
- üé® Emotion visualization with colors and icons
- üåì Dark mode support
- üì± Responsive design

## Development Process

This project was developed through the following process:

1. **PRD Creation**: Wrote a Product Requirements Document (PRD) to set development direction
2. **Cursor AI Utilization**: Communicated requirements to Cursor AI for code generation by feature
3. **Component Development**: Implemented UI components using ShadCN UI
4. **Emotion Analysis Logic**: Integrated Google Gemini API and implemented emotion analysis logic
5. **Theme Settings**: Implemented dark mode and light mode switching functionality
6. **Local Storage Integration**: Saved diary data and theme settings
